## Required Technologies

Your application must make use of the following libraries:

- Postgres for the database
- Node/Express for the application logic
- dotenv from npm for managing environment variables
- db-migrate from npm for migrations
- jsonwebtoken from npm for working with JWTs
- jasmine from npm for testing


# open two terminals 

## In a terminal tab, create and run the database:

- run `su postgres` to connection for postgres
- run `psql postgres` for connection of sql
- run `CREATE USER users_names WITH PASSWORD 'password123';` for creating a new user
- `CREATE DATABASE store;` a database for store
- `CREATE DATABASE store_test;` a database for store_test
- `\c store` connect to database 
- `  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE store TO users_names;  `


##### In the 2nd terminal:

- install yarn `npm install yarn -g`
- install db-migrate on the machine for terminal commands `npm install db-migrate -g`
- check node version `node -v` - it needs to be 10 or 12 level
- IF node was not 10 or 12 level, run
    - `npm install -g n`
    - `n 10.18.0`
    - `PATH="$PATH"`
    - `node -v` to check that the version is 10 or 12
- install all project dependencies `yarn`
- to test that it is working, run `yarn watch` should show an app starting on `0.0.0.0:3000`
